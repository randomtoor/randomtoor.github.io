The Portuguese Canadian violinist Paul Medeiros completed his Bachelor of Music in performance at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada under the tutelage of Professor Philippe Djokic and Shimon Walt. He won on two occasions the Dalhousie “Concerto Night” competition, performing the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto and Ravel’s Tzigane with the Dalhousie Symphony Orchestra. Paul also appeared twice as soloist with the Dalhousie Chamber Orchestra, performing Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto in d minor and Vivaldi’s celebrated Four Seasons. Paul is notably the recipient of the 2006 Ramon Hnatyshyn Foundation Award, a Canadian national prize awarded annually to one young artist who shows exceptional talent and promise for a successful career. Also in Canada, Paul has toured with a number of Canadian pop stars, such as Anne Murray and Sarah Slean, and has performed with Symphony Nova Scotia as a section violinist and violist.

Since moving to the Netherlands in September 2010, Paul has performed with orchestra ‘Ostravská Banda’ (Czech-Republic), the Paradiso Orchestra (comprised of members of the Rotterdam Philharmonic and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra), Sinfonia Rotterdam, and Dutch stars Wouter Hamel and Douwe Bob. He has participated in the masterclasses of Pinchas Zuckerman, Regis Pasquier, Yehonathan Berick, Jeanne Lamon, Maarten Veeze, Philippe Graffin, en David Früwirth. After Canada, Paul furthered his studies at the Amsterdam Conservatory with Lex Korff de Gidts and Cornelis Koelmans, graduating in June 2012 with a master's degree in violin performance. Presently, he is very much active as a chamber musician. Besides working with the Bering Trio, Paul is a violinist with Ardesko chamber orchestra, an international group of 15 string players who recently recorded their first CD, Our World. Additionally, Paul performs in a number of duos, including collaborations with pianist David Herman (Amsterdam), organist Stefan Donner (Vienna) and cellist Aleksandra Kaspera (Latvia). Since November 2014, Paul is the violinist and arranger for Villa met Uitzicht, a flute quartet which presents a series of concept programmes often with the elements of visual art and spoken word combined in one concert. In July 2015, Villa met Uitzicht recorded their first album, Carnival in Venice, comprised of Paul’s arrangements of famous opera scenes and arias from the 19th and 20th centuries. Since a young age, Paul has also taken much interest in the baroque arts. He currently plays with the Laurensorkest in Rotterdam, an orchestra dedicated to the choral music of J.S. Bach.

Besides working as a freelance artist, Paul is a violin and viola teacher at De Vioolschool in Haarlem, where he currently has a studio of 13 pupils and gives coaching in chamber and orchestral performance.

Paul plays on a violin made in 1953 by Luigi Vistoli in Lugo, Italy.
