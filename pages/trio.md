The Bering Trio (based in the Netherlands) is composed of Canadian violinist Paul Medeiros, American violist/violinist Ian de Jong and Latvian cellist Aleksandra Kaspera. A strong comradery based on a shared love of chamber music brings these players together.


The Bering Trio is rooted in the tradition of the string trio (Violin-viola-cello or two violins and a cello), an ensemble that became popular among court nobility in the mid-18th century and was often featured in the compositions of Haydn, Boccherini and Beethoven. The ensemble was founded in 2013 by Aleksandra Kaspera and Paul Medeiros, during a Dutch tour with the Ardesko Chamber Orchestra. Starting off as a string quartet, the group quickly realized that a string trio would offer the ensemble more exciting and diverse opportunities. With Ian de Jong joining the ensemble in the summer of 2014, the trio took its first steps to forming a new chamber music identity. The Bering String Trio presents concerts in a wide range of styles, frequently supplementing its ensemble with talented international musicians. Bering's flexibility and eagerness to collaborate offers a world of possibilities to the ensemble and the concert programmer alike. Possible formations include string quartet (Bering + violinist), accordion quartet (Bering + accordionist), and piano quartet (Bering + pianist). The Bering Trio made its Amsterdam debut at the national monument Huis de Pinto, playing Franz Schubert's string trio D.471, Sitovetsky's transcription of J.S. Bach's Goldberg Variations, Dohnányi's Serenade and the Bagatelles of Anton Dvorák (originally for Harmonium and string trio) with accordionist Jevgenijs Pastuhovs. In September 2015 the ensemble collaborated with Stichting Music Take In, for concerts featuring Bach's "Bauern" Cantata.


In the short time it has existed, The Bering Trio has played a variety of concerts and events and has recorded both classical and other styles of music in a studio setting. The trio is available for all types of concerts and events. The musicians are committed to a fresh take on traditional classical music and exploration with rarely-heard ensembles and cross-genre innovations.
